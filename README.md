### My Trip to France

We left Camp Beaugard at 1045 a.m. on the 14 of August.  We had pullman cars
for the trip.  We stopped in the switch yards of Shreivesport LA. while the red
cross gave us refreshments and tabacco.  Our next stop was Jonesbourough Ark.
where we detrained and took exercise.  The next time we left the train was at
Decatur Ill. where we had a good bath and sweets from the red cross again.  We
went through Laffette Ind.  Late in the evening we crossed into Canada at
Detroit Mich.  About 3 o'clock in the morning I woke up cold and looked out of
the window.  The first thing I saw was a Canadian Solider.  We traveled until
day light along lake St Clair.  We got off at St Thomas.  We could notice the
difference in the country and people and we missed the Red Cross.  We took a
hike over the city.  We saw a company of negroes there.  Our next stop was at
Niagra where we hiked out to the falls. We crossed the Niagra river over into
the states.  We were glad to get back into the U.S. even if we were not out of
it over 12 hours.  Our next stop of any importance was at Mauchchunk Pa.  We
did not get off the train.  This is a very interesting town being a summer
resort there was a good many people there.  The town is located on two ridges
with the Le High river running between.  We followed the Le High river as it
wound its way down the mountain.  The rial road was first on one side then on
the other. We could look out of one side of the car down upon swift running
water and out of the other side we could not see the top of the mountain and
part of the time not even the sky.  The same day we went past the Betheleham
steel works here we was welcomed by whistles of all tones and they was held
down as long as we were within hearing.  We arrived in the New York Station at
about 3:15 p.m. on the 18th of August.  Here we loaded on a small steamer which
carried us over to Long Island.  We passed pretty close to the Statute of
Liberty and saw the tallest building in New York on Long Island.  We were put
on steel passanger cars which had Long Island along the top in large letters.
We saw some fine country on our way to camp.  We arrived at camp about 7:30
p.m.  Our first night in Camp was a little cool for we had only one blanket and
it gets pretty cool at night in August on Long Island.

We were wearing campagn hats and canvas leggings while all the other
organizations were wearing over sea caps and spirral leggings.  We felt a
little out of place until we were issued them.  I did not get to go to rockaway
beach or New York while we were there on account of not having the money.
There was air planes in the air all day doing all kins of stunts.  I saw
several hydroplanes flying over.  On the evening of the 27 of August we were
given orders to role our packs and get read y to move.  It was generaly thought
that we were going to Camp Merrit which is just over in New Jersey.  That night
we sleeped on bare springs.  A while before the day light we fell out with
packs was counted off given squads right and marched off down the road.  We
loaded on cars at day break and taken to the same station that we come through
when we come over.  We were loaded on a small steamer which started down the
Hudson.  We passed the entrence of the harbor then we come in sight of the U.S.
transport piers.  We knew then where we were going.  Then we come in sight of a
large three funnel (a metal chimney on a steam ship) ship and we were much
suprised and pleased when we were loaded on it.  It was the Levienthian of the
Fatherland the largest ship afloat.  We loaded on about 1:00 p.m.  About 3:00
p.m. a guard list was called off and I was one of them.  I go ta post on the
same deck as the battery was guarding a water tite door.  We were on 4 hours
and off 8.  So I got the morning on deck.  We sailed at 1 p.m. on 31st of
August.  There were two other transports with us the Great Northern and the
Northern Pacific.  There were two or three bands on the pier playing as we
pulled out by tugs.  I was on guard while we were going out of the harbor and
when I came on deck at 4 O'clock I could just see a little fringe of land off
to the left.  I saw my first flying fish that evening while looking over the
rail at the water.  There was four submarines destroyers with us that evening.
The next morning I went on deck and there was the same things just as there was
the night before except the land. Then the ships begin a zigzag course.  The
boat began to rock and role and we began to get light headed.  And sometimes it
would seem as though I was walking up hill and then I would start down another.
I would start down stairs to another deck and it would seem as though the
stairs were coming up to meet me. The next morning the destroyers had
disappeared and we were alone with the other two transports.  We went on until
two days out of port we were met by a convoy. I had started to climb up to my
bunk when one of the destroyers dropped a depth bomb which shook the boat so
that I almost lost my hold.  We sighted land a little while after dinner and
arrived in the harbor of Breast at about 5 pm.m on the 7th of September.

The ship was so large tht they culd not get it up to the piers and had to
anchor it out in the harbor.  We did not get off until about 5:30 on the
evening of the 8th of Sept.  Then we loaded on another little steamer and was
taken ashore.  We were started on our hike to the rest camp.  We hadn't started
until it begin to rain and it rained on us all the way to camp which was about
3 miles.  We had to pitch our pup tents that night.  We finally got to bed
about 11:00.  The next morning I was woke up by some one running over my tent
and broke the rear tent pole and steppe don my bunkies face.  It had stopped
raining but not for long. We were wondering where they got sunny France out of
that.  This was a rest camp.  But we had plenty of work buildings ware houses
and unloading boats.  We were sure glad to leave there which we did on Sunday
the 15th of Sept.  It happended to be a nice sunny day.  We loaded on box cars
which were marked on the side 40 hommes or 8 cheaveaux which means 40 men or 8
horses.  There was 40 men in the car I wa sin and it filled it full.  We left
Breast about 7.pm. for our ride across France.  That night we did not sleep
much because we could not lay down on teh floor .  The next morning we unloaded
about 9 o'clock at Messac. We hiked over to Bain about 9 Kilomters (6 miles).
We were pretty well played out when we arrived there late in the evening.  we
were billeted inn lofts of barns and got a good nights sleeep.  we had a cold
supper the night that we arrived in Bain but we ate like hungry dogs.  The only
time I really saw soldiers eat their corn willie with such an appitite.  We
hadn't had anything to eat for 24 hours.  I was promoted to corporal while we
were here.  We drilled every day and went through all kinds of setting up
exercises.  We had two new Lieutants and they put us in the best physical shape
that we have ever been in by double timing us until we were out of breath and
then putting us through all kind of movements standing until we were ready to
double time some more. we stayed here until the 27th of Sept. I was sent on the
26th with a detail of 15 men to Messac for the purpose of loading supplys for
the Brigade. I stayed here for 10 days. we were billeted in a barn of a large
chateau. We had an easy time. We were working about half of the time. Messac is
on the main rail rod between Rennes and St Magaine. The French soldiers stopped
here on their leaves. On the 7th of Oct. we loaded on a passanger train and
went over to camp Coetquidan and I joined my organization. I started to a
signal (telephone) school. We fired the first time on the range here on the
15th of Oct. We only fired one gun. We fired every few days until the 5th of
Nov. Then we begin the Brigade problem which lasted until the evening of the
6th. I was in the telephone dugout just behind the gun. And the night of the
5th when the first shot went off, it blew out our candle and left us in the
dark. While doing all the firing on the range, we had to carry our wire out
there by hand which was very heavy. On the 11th when the armists was signed we
were out on the range firing but were to busy to realize what had happened. On
the 16th of Nov. we started for Valdahon as a school of fire. The first Btn was
the only one. We passed through Rennes and Paris and Dijon. It was so cold that
one of the boys in my car got off when they stopped and got a bucket and we
built a fire in it and had a pretty good fire. It was a little smoky but it
helped. We arrived at Valdahon about 8p.m. on the 19th of Nov. It was cold and
the ground froze but clear and the stars shining. The 140th was already here
and they halled our equipment up to camp. We did not do anything but a little
drilling through the rest of Nov. We had a big Christmas dinner. Col. Owneby
and the rest of our officers ate dinner with us. Then they had a Christmas tree
at the Y.M.C.A. We did not do but very little in Jan and on the 10th of Jan., I
started my 7 day leave. Left Besancon at 11:15 p.m. on the 10th of Jan arrived
at Dijon at 1:30. Left Dijon at 3:22 arrived in Lyon at 8:30 a.m. Arrived in

and they would not let us stay there. So they sent us down on the Spanish
bordor. Left Toulouse at 5:50 p.m. arrived in Montrejeau at 11 p.m. got rooms
and went to bed. Left there at 9:30 a.m. 14 Jan. arrived in Bagneres De Luchon

camp on the 25th of Jan.

We started the first school of fire on the 4th of Feb. This school lasted until
25th. Our next school began on the 6th of March. One of the French 75 blew up
during this school and killed three of the crew. This school closed on the
26th. The weather was very bad through both of these schools. A quad truck
could not get off the road without miring and would have to be pulled out by
the tractors which would seldom mire down. They might half bury themselves in
the mud but they would most generally find solid ground and pull out. April 7th
the instructors calibrated the guns of "A". Battery No. 3 gun was in the repair
shop. They fired 92 rounds and run our of ammunition at 10 O'clock. It was a
fine day it look as if spring has come. Thursday, April 10th, the third school
began today. I am recording at the battery. It is pretty cold and my hand gets
so cold that I can hardly write. Walter is operating at the B.C. The officer
that picked the battery position made a mistake and put the battery in the rong
area. We did not fire that evening. We went out Friday morning. It was raining.
We wore our steel helmets, rain coats, and rubber boats. The position was area
1 and in a mud hole. The minimum elevation was 370 on No. 3 gun and it was out
most of the time. The reel cart gears hangs and they have to leave the wire out
there. It was so foggy that they had to stop firing at 10 O'clock. We did not
go out that evening. Everybody had to spend the evening in making a general
clean up. The gun crews tractor truck and car drivers had to wash all the mud
off of there vehicle. Saturday morning Capt. Willis of B battery inspected us
and our equipment. While Capt. Brogdon inspected Battery B. We had the evening
off and I spent it in reading the "Hertage of the Desert." Sunday Morning the
reconessence car left at 5 O'clock for the front with the sergents. At 8:30 5
trucks left loaded with men for a joy ride. They got back at 4:00 O'clock. It
